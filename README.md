Music Releases
This project was a pair-programming collaboration between Naushin Malik, Linnea Isebrink and Madelene Trang. The aim of the project was to build a music site using JSX and React components. To fetch information from a data set, we used map function to iterate over an array. In this project we also learned how to mount many components.

This is the very first encounter with React and it was challenge to get used to the new structure. But we managed and we have met all the requirements and are over all happy with our work.
